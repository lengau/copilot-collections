# Update Starbase

## Add the remote and merge Starbase

Run the preparation script from the root of the child repository:

```bash
bash <path-to-skill>/scripts/prepare_merge.sh [BRANCH_SUFFIX]
```

- `BRANCH_SUFFIX` is optional; defaults to today's date
  (`work/update-starbase-YYYY-MM-DD`).
- The script handles steps 1–6: safe-state check, remote setup, fetch,
  work-branch creation, merge, and conflict detection.
- It exits **non-zero and prints `MERGE RESULT: merge-conflicted`** if
  the merge stops with conflicts, or exits **zero and prints
  `MERGE RESULT: merge-clean`** on success.
- In both cases the script prints a **`NEXT STEPS FOR THE AGENT`** block
  listing exactly what to do next — read it and follow it.

If the script cannot be run, follow [`references/manual_merge_steps.md`](references/manual_merge_steps.md) instead.

After the script completes, follow the `NEXT STEPS FOR THE AGENT` block it
printed. The steps below expand on each item in detail:

1. If GitHub reports conflicts with `main`, fetch the latest `origin/main` and
   redo the merge from that branch before continuing.

2. Clean up placeholder text in all merged files (both conflicted and cleanly merged):
   Scan all files that were added or modified by the merge for any remaining "Starcraft" or "Starbase" placeholder text:

   ```bash
   git diff --name-only --diff-filter=d starbase/main...HEAD | xargs -r grep -i -E "starcraft|starbase"
   ```

   Update any matches found (except external docs/style guide URLs) to use the child repository's name and purpose.

3. Document change provenance on each file:
   For every file added, deleted, or modified by the merge, make review comments on the GitHub PR explaining the provenance of the changes. Additionally, post inline review comments pointing out specific custom changes (e.g., removing a duplicate directive or fixing a type ignore).
   Files that already existed in the child repository and merged cleanly without conflicts or custom changes do not need a comment.
   **Provenance and rationale for manual changes belong exclusively in PR review comments, never as comments inside the source file.** If you catch yourself writing "why a bot changed this" as a `#`/`//` comment in code, stop and move it to a PR review comment instead. This applies just as much to config files like `docs/conf.py`: e.g. explaining *why* only specific `sphinx_toolbox` submodules are loaded (instead of the top-level package) belongs in a PR file-level comment, not a multi-line `#` block above the `extensions` entries.
   The comments must follow these guidelines:
   - **Prefix Template**: Each comment must begin with a robot emoji and a prefix in square brackets announcing that a bot wrote it, along with the model and harness. E.g. `🤖 [BEEP BOOP, A BOT WROTE THIS COMMENT - <model>, <harness>]`.
     Example: `🤖 [BEEP BOOP, A BOT WROTE THIS COMMENT - Gemini 3.5 Flash (High), antigravity]`
   - **Provenance Descriptions**:
     - For new files: `"new file from starbase"`
     - For modified files: `"file updated from starbase"`
     - For renamed or moved files: `"file moved in starbase"`
     - For complex/mixed files (e.g. `uv.lock` or `pyproject.toml`): Provide specific intermediate/complex details (e.g. `"file updated from starbase (child-owned file, regenerated locally based on merged dependencies)"`).
   - **Implementation via GitHub API**:
     - Post file-level comments on the PR using the REST API (`POST /repos/{owner}/{repo}/pulls/{pull_number}/comments`) with the `"subject_type": "file"` parameter so that a specific line number is not required.
     - Post inline line-level review comments for specific code changes (specifying `"line"` and `"side": "RIGHT"`) to highlight specific modifications made (such as resolving duplicate extensions or custom linter ignores).
     - **Handling Rate Limits**: When posting a batch of comments, enforce a delay (e.g., 4-5 seconds) between calls to avoid GitHub's spam rate limiter (`was submitted too quickly`). Implement an automatic backoff/retry (e.g., sleeping 30 seconds upon hitting a rate limit) to guarantee all comments are registered.
   - **Own-invention workarounds require a suggestion, not a direct push**: for
     a change that is neither sourced from `starbase/main` nor an obvious
     conflict resolution — for example, a hand-written workaround like adding
     an `export SPHINX_OPTS := ... -j 1` override to fix a `--fail-on-warning`
     failure caused by a Sphinx extension's parallel-read warning — do not
     push the change directly into the merge commit. Instead, push the merge
     without it, then leave an inline review comment at the relevant location
     using the standard robot-prefix template that explains the problem and
     proposes the fix as an actual GitHub suggestion (a fenced
     ` ```suggestion ` block), so a human reviewer can review and apply it
     explicitly rather than the bot self-approving its own invented fix.

## Output

Report one of:
- `merge-clean`: Starbase merged with no conflicts.
- `merge-conflicted`: merge stopped with conflicts, including the file list from `git status --short`.

## Pre-PR validation (required)

Before creating a PR, ensure repository checks pass:

```bash
make format
make lint
make test-fast
```

Do not create the PR until these commands complete successfully.

## PR labeling (required)

When opening the PR, apply the label:
- `PR: Merge`

## PR review and CI

- Open the PR as a draft, request a Copilot review while it is still draft, and
  keep iterating until the review is clean enough to mark ready.
- Check the PR's CI status before handing it off.
- If CI is still running or likely to fail, start a background agent to watch
  the PR checks and report failures so they can be fixed promptly.
- You do not need to wait for the full matrix to finish before fixing failures
  in jobs that are already failing or have enough signal to act on.
- While the PR is still in draft (fixing initial CI failures and addressing
  the first round of review comments), make separate commits for each
  follow-up fix rather than amending; this keeps the history of what changed
  and why easy to review incrementally.
- Squash the follow-up-fix commits back into the single merge commit twice,
  at two distinct points:
  1. Once CI is green and the PR is ready to come out of draft: squash all
     follow-up-fix commits made so far into the original merge commit, then:
     - **Non-interactive harness**: mark the PR ready for review.
     - **Interactive harness**: do *not* mark the PR ready. Instead, send the
       operator a message with the draft PR URL and a brief summary (what was
       merged, any conflicts resolved, any custom changes made) and stop.
       Leave promoting the PR to the operator.
  2. Right before the final merge into the base branch: squash any further
     follow-up commits made during the ready-for-review round (e.g., fixes
     from human reviewers) back into that same single merge commit.
  Between these two squash points, follow-up fixes should again land as
  separate commits, not be squashed continuously.
- **The provenance/documentation rules in "Document change provenance on each
  file" apply for the entire life of the PR, not just the initial merge.**
  Any manual code change made while fixing CI failures or responding to review
  feedback — including one-line bugfixes — must be explained via a PR review
  comment (inline on the changed line, using the same robot-prefix template),
  never as a comment added to the source file itself. Do not add explanatory
  `#`/`//` comments to files to document *why a bot made this change*; source
  comments are only for genuinely non-obvious code, not for change provenance.
- Post each of these follow-up-fix review comments (and remember the
  robot-prefix template) in the same turn you push the corresponding fix —
  don't defer it, and don't wait to be reminded.

## Refreshing a stale merge PR (required when either main has moved on)

If significant time has passed since the merge PR was opened and either
`origin/main` or `starbase/main` has gained new commits, do not layer another
merge commit on top of the existing one. Instead, rebuild the merge commit
from the current heads of both branches while preserving every follow-up-fix
commit already pushed to the PR:

1. `git fetch origin --prune && git fetch starbase --prune` to get both
   branches' latest state.
2. Create a fresh branch from the current `origin/main` (do not reuse the old
   merge base): `git checkout -b <new-branch> origin/main`.
3. `git merge --no-ff --no-commit starbase/main` and resolve conflicts using
   the same file-ownership map and decisions as the original merge. Diff the
   new merge tree against the old merge commit
   (`git diff <new-working-tree> <old-merge-commit> --stat`) to catch any
   conflict-map resolutions, placeholder-text cleanups, or lint-rule fixes
   that the new merge silently skipped (for example, because
   `starbase/main` didn't touch a file that the old merge still needed to
   modify, so git raises no conflict for it at all — reapply those changes
   manually from the old merge commit).
4. Commit the merge using the same commit message template as any other
   Starbase merge (see "Merge commit message format"), updating the date.
5. Cherry-pick every follow-up-fix commit from the old branch, in order, onto
   the new merge commit: `git cherry-pick <fix-1> <fix-2> ...`. These commits
   must be preserved, not redone from scratch or squashed away.
6. Re-run the pre-PR validation commands (`make format`, `make lint`,
   `make docs`; `make test-fast` at your discretion) against the rebuilt
   branch before pushing.
7. Force-push the rebuilt branch to the existing PR branch (use
   `--force-with-lease` against the branch's current remote tip for safety).
8. Update the PR title's date to match the new merge date (see "Merge commit
   message format" for the title/subject format). `gh pr edit --title` can
   spuriously fail on repos with legacy Projects (classic) boards; if it
   errors, fall back to
   `gh api repos/{owner}/{repo}/pulls/{number} -X PATCH -f title="..."` and
   confirm the new title with a follow-up `gh pr view --json title`.
9. Post a PR comment (standard robot-prefix template) noting that history was
   rewritten and force-pushed, and summarizing what changed on each side
   (new commits pulled in from `origin/main` and/or `starbase/main`) and
   confirming the follow-up-fix commits were preserved.

## Merge commit message format

When finalizing the Starbase merge commit, include the merge date as an
ISO 8601 date only (`YYYY-MM-DD`) in the commit message.

Do not include time or timezone.

Example:
- `chore(merge): update starbase (2026-06-18)`

The commit body must include a concise overview of the Starbase changes that
were pulled in (for example: build-system updates, workflow changes, docs
tooling changes, or dependency-management adjustments).

Use this template:

```text
chore(merge): update starbase (<ISO-8601-DATE: YYYY-MM-DD>)

Merge `starbase/main` into this branch and sync Starbase-managed updates.

Overview of Starbase changes pulled in:
- <high-level change area 1>
- <high-level change area 2>
- <high-level change area 3>
- <high-level change area 4>

Conflict resolution applied:
- Kept child-repo version of `<child-owned-file-1>` (`--ours`).
- Kept child-repo version of `<child-owned-file-2>` (`--ours`).
- Took full `<source-of-truth-file-1>` from `starbase/main` (source-of-truth file).
- Took full `<source-of-truth-file-2>` from `starbase/main` (source-of-truth file).
- For this `<library|application>` repo:
  - kept `<agents-template-file-to-delete-1>` deleted,
  - kept `<agents-template-file-to-delete-2>` deleted,
  - kept `AGENTS.md` authoritative and applied relevant updates from `<agents-template-reference-file>`.
```

## Conflict resolution

When resolving merge conflicts, consult
[`references/file_ownership.md`](references/file_ownership.md) for the
complete ownership map and decision rules, including:

- **Conflict rule 1** – File ownership map (always take starbase, always take
  child, and mixed-ownership rules by file/section).
- **Conflict rule 2** – Python type annotation modernisation (when to apply
  `X | Y`, `tuple[X, Y]`, etc., and Python version caveats).
- **Conflict rule 3** – AGENTS template handling (library vs. application
  repositories).
